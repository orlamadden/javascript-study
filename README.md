# Javascript Notes :pencil2:

I am currently undertaking the [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) course by Wes Bos. I wanted a place to store my notes and share my learnings so I can become more knowledgeable about Javascript.

Sharing my notes on this repo was inspired by [@geekysrm](https://github.com/geekysrm/javascript-notes) who Wes linked to in his Beginner Javascript repo.

I hope this approach to note-taking will help me with my own journey in learning JS, allowing me to write it in a way that I will understand.
